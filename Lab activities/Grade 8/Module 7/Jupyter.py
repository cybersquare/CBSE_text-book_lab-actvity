#Step #1: After successfully installing Jupyter write ‘jupyter notebook’ in the terminal/command prompt. This will open a new notebook server on your web browser.
#Step #2: On the top left corner, click on the new button and select python3. This will open a new notebook tab in your browser where you can start to write your first code.
#Step #3: Press Enter or click on the first cell in your notebook to go into the edit mode.
#Step #4: Now you are free to write any code.
#Step #5: You can run your code by pressing Shift + Enter or the run button provided at the top. An example code is given below:

# This program add two numbers

num1 = 2
num2 = 5

# Add two numbers
sum = num1 + num2

# Display the sum
print('The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, sum))
