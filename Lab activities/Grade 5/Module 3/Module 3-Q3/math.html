                <p>Area and perimeter, in Maths, are the two important properties of two-dimensional shapes. Perimeter defines the distance of the boundary of the shape whereas area explains the region occupied by it. Area and Perimeter is an important topic
                    in Mathematics, which is used in everyday life. This is applicable to any shape and size whether it is regular or irregular. Every shape has its own area and perimeter formula. You must have learned about different shapes such as triangle,
                    square, rectangle, circle, sphere, etc. The area and perimeter of all shapes are explained here. Applications of area and perimeter can be seen in everyday life, such as finding the floor area of the house, the area of the footpath
                    that will surround the ground, fencing the park with a wire, etc.
