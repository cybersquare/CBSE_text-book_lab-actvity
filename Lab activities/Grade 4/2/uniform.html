            <p>The type of motion in which the object travels in a straight line with uniform speed, is called Uniform
                motion. This means that the velocity of the body remains constant as it covers equal distances in equal
                intervals of time. In the case of uniform rectilinear motion, the acceleration of the body will be zero.
                Here, the average speed of the object will be equal to the actual speed. Examples of uniform motion are
                a car moving with constant velocity, a boy running in a straight path with constant speed etc.</p>
